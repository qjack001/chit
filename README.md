[Chit](https://chitgpt.netlify.app/) (pronounced with the 'ch' of _"chef"_) is a chatbot bringing the incredible and
uncredible powers of Large Language Models to the old web. Now, for the first time, you can utilize AI from IE.

#### Features:

- no CSS
- no client-side JavaScript


The site uses good ol' form submissions, anchor links, and table layout provide a near-splitting image of the chatbots
you know and love, with none of the JavaScript or CSS. This allows the site to be used with JavaScript disabled, or
from browsers that don't support modern web standards.

Under the hood, this is just calling Gemini. Don't put anything into this thing you wouldn't want me or Google seeing.
And go easy on my tokens. Note to self: you can use the
[billing dashboard](https://aistudio.google.com/usage?project=gen-lang-client-0633390746) to track token usage.
